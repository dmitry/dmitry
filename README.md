### About

As a Fullstack Software Engineer with over 17 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable platforms using Ruby on Rails and modern JavaScript frameworks. I have deep expertise in B2B and consumer applications, with a strong focus on backend architecture, real-time features, and API design. I optimise system performance, implement robust testing strategies, and maintain clean, maintainable codebases. With a proven track record of leading small engineering teams, I balance rapid MVP delivery with sustainable, long-term development practices, ensuring high-quality solutions that scale.

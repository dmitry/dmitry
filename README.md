### About

As a Fullstack Software Engineer with over 17 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable platforms using Ruby on Rails and modern JavaScript frameworks. I have deep expertise in B2B and consumer applications, with a strong focus on backend architecture, real-time features, and API design. I optimise system performance, implement robust testing strategies, and maintain clean codebases. Skilled at building MVPs that scale, with a focus on sustainable architecture and team development. I am also a contributor to the Ruby on Rails framework, with more than several patches merged into the core codebase.
